## Context and Problem Statement

How to process authentication for UCSD students and professors?

## Considered Options

* Linking to UCSD Authentication API
* Custom Authentication using CSV file

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Custom Authentication", UCSD Authentication API is outside the scope and timeline of this project. A custom authentication using CSV file is a good alternative.
